  <p>I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
    <br>Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
    <br>Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
    <br>And they ain't got on no bra (no bra)
    <br>Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
    <br>And now she screamin' out, "no más" (yeah, yeah, yeah)
    <br>They like "Savage, why you got a 12 car garage and you only got 6 cars?" (21)
    <br>I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (kiss that?)
    <br>Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (big snack)
    <br>Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (old racks)
    <br>L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at?" (21, 21)
    <br>Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
    <br>Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
    <br>I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
    <br>Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar
  </p>
  <p>
    [Chorus: Post Malone & 21 Savage]
    <br>Ayy, I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
    <br>Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star)
    <br>Ayy, ayy, all my brothers got that gas
    <br>And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
    <br>Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
    <br>And show up, name them the shottas
    <br>>When my homies pull up on your block
    <br>They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (grrra-ta-ta-ta)
